\subsection{Normal Forms}

Intuitionistic logic does not enjoy the myriad normal form transformations
available in classical logic.  It is known that the choice of normal form
can lead to dramatically different search spaces.  For example, there are
formulas $F$ such that the difference in length of the shortest proof of $F$
given different normal forms is non-elementary.~\cite{Baaz.2001.Handbook}
