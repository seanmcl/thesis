* Syntax

* Semantics

** Sequent calculus

multisets
backward sequents
backward rules
{,non}invertible rules
subformula property
weakening, contraction, exchange are admissible

* Inverse method

forward sequents
forward rules
completeness
kept and active databases (Otter loop)
rule generation
rule matching
proof terms
signed subformulas
contraction
can't in general prove a sequent, only one that subsumes it P, Q ===> P

* Polarization

* Focusing

* Polarized inverse method

derived rules
rule matching

* Proof term assignment

* Optimizations

** Globalization
** Subsumption
*** Forward
*** Backward
*** Rule
**** Disable branch on exact match

** Biimplication continuation
** Conflicts


* Logical optimizations

problem: exponentially many stable sequents, or exponentially many hypotheses in a rule.
simulation of focusing strategies (single step, weak, fair weak, pos/neg atoms)

* Implementation

** ILTP
** Random
** Classical
   translations to classical logic, comparison with number
